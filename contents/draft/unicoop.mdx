### Summary

Wizonline or Goonline is a research product by PT. Vascomm in 2020. It started with the impact of the Covid-19 pandemic on the business line as an Indonesian banking partner. To deal with this, a product was created to pivot and get other sources of income. One of the projects was Wizonline. In this project, I worked as a fullstack developer.

### Project Goals

The main goal of this project is to provide a platform for SMEs to create a website for their business. The main feature of this project is very simple, where users can easily create a website. Various types of templates are provided for various types of businesses so that users can customize them to their business. In addition, a wide and easy custom feature is also one of the points of this feature.

### Problems and Lessons Learned

The main problem I encountered in this project is how to provide custom features that are as easy and simple as possible but can meet user needs. Research began by looking for packages or those that can be customized, after getting a builder choice, the next problem is how to break down a website template to support the use of the builder that has been made.
